'''Khronos lock-surface extension for EGL.

I can't find any official specification for this extension; it appears
to have gone offline when http://developer.symbian.org/ was closed.
However, support is widely available through the Mesa library, which
specifies the following signature in eglmesaext.h:

    EGLBoolean eglSwapBuffersRegionNOK(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLSurface surface,
                                       EGLint numRects,
                                       const EGLint* rects);
