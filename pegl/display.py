    In EGL, a display is not only a representation of a (physical or
    virtual) display device; it is also the overall context of all EGL
    operations (although "context" also has a different meaning in EGL).
    As such, details of the EGL implementation are accessed from a
    Display instance.

    Instance attributes:
        dhandle -- The foreign object handle for this display.
        client_apis -- A string listing the client APIs supported (such
            as OpenGL, OpenGL_ES, and OpenVG), separated by spaces.
            Although I can't find it specified in the EGL standard, it
            seems likely that these will be limited to ASCII.
        extensions -- A string listing the EGL extensions supported,
            again separated by spaces and probably ASCII.
        vendor -- The vendor string for this EGL implementation.
        version -- A 3-tuple describing the implementation version, in
            the format (major, minor, vendor_info).

                display is requested.
            native_id -- An identifier for a platform-native display.
                This is ignored if dhandle is supplied. If both are
                omitted, the EGL default display is requested.
            delay_init -- If True, the display's initialize() method
                will not be called automatically. This should then be
                done by the application before doing any EGL operations.
