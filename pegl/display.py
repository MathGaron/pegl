    '''An EGL display.

    In EGL, a display is not only a representation of a (physical or
    virtual) display device; it is also the overall context of all EGL
    operations (although "context" also has a different meaning in EGL).
    As such, details of the EGL implementation are accessed from a
    Display instance.

    Instance attributes:
        dhandle -- The foreign object handle for this display.
        client_apis -- A string describing the client APIs supported
            (such as OpenGL, OpenGL_ES, and OpenVG). Although the value
            is implementation-defined, it will likely be a list of API
            names delimited by spaces.
        extensions -- A string describing the EGL extensions supported.
            Again, this is likely to be a space-delimited list.
        vendor -- The vendor string for this EGL implementation.
        version -- A string describing the implementation version.

                native_id is used instead.
            native_id -- An identifier for a platform-native display.
                This is ignored if dhandle is supplied. If both are
                omitted, the EGL default display is requested.
            delay_init -- If True, the display's initialize() method
                will not be called automatically. This should be done
                by the application before doing any EGL operations.
