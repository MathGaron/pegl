        display -- The EGL display to which this surface belongs, an
            instance of Display.
        config -- The configuration with which this surface was created,
            an instance of Config.
        attribs -- The attributes with which this surface was created,
            an instance of Attribs.

        Subclasses will need to call the foreign function that actually
        creates their particular surface type, and then set shandle to
        the returned result.
